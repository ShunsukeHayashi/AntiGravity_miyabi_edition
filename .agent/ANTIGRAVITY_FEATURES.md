# Antigravity Features & Documentation

## Task List
A task list is an artifact that the agent uses to approach complex tasks and monitor progress on various action items. You can find a live snapshot of what the agent is doing in this artifact, which is constructed as a markdown list of items related to research, implementation, verification, and more. This type of artifact is generally used by the agent to keep on track with the user’s overarching goal; typically, you do not need to directly interact with this artifact.

## Implementation Plan
Agent utilizes the implementation plan artifact to architect changes within your codebase to accomplish a task. These plans contain technical details on what revisions are necessary and are meant to be reviewed by the user. Below is an example plan generated by the agent.

### Artifact Implementation Plan
Unless you have you artifact review policy set to “Always Proceed” [link to docs on this setting], Agent will typically request your review on the implementation plan before making the changes needed to complete your task. You can click either the in-conversation or artifact header “Proceed” button to instantly continue with Agent’s plan.

### Artifact Implementation Plan Proceed
Oftentimes, Agent will create a plan that is slightly different from what you exactly want. Antigravity supports commenting on these artifacts so you can provide feedback to Agent for any reason, whether it be to decrease scope of changes, use a different tech stack, or correct any Agent discrepancies.

### Artifact Implementation Plan Comments
Once you have left comments on the implementation plan, you can still use the “Proceed” to continue with Agent’s plan; alternatively, you can also toggle the “Review” button in the artifact header, where you can examine all comments and leave a message as feedback instead of directly proceeding, if needed.

### Artifact Implementation Plan Submit Comments
Once you have proceeded or left a review, Agent will continue its work, either iterating on the implementation plan and re-requesting your review or beginning with its work!

## Artifacts > Walkthrough

### Walkthrough
Agent creates walkthrough artifacts when it has completed task implementation; this type of artifact includes a concise summary of the changes that have been made to remind the user of what has happened in the active conversation. This is a great way to get up to speed with the state of your codebase after Agent has made its changes in case you were not strictly following it the whole time.

### Walkthrough
For browser tasks, walkthroughs often contain screenshots and screen recordings of what Agent has built or created in the browser!

## Artifacts > Screenshots

### Screenshots
The browser subagent can take screenshots of open pages or elements on pages when it would like your review of the state of the page. This is surfaced as a tool to the agent, and you can also prompt the agent to take a screenshot of a page.

### Browser Screenshot Capture Tool
All screenshots are saved as image artifacts and can be commented on to give feedback to the agent.

## Artifacts > Browser Recordings

### Browser Recordings
Every time the browser subagent actuates on the Browser, it may choose to generate a recording of the agent’s actions for your review. You can view this playback, if it is available, at the bottom of the Browser step UI.

### Browser Recording Capture Tool
All browser recordings are also saved as a recording artifact for your review. This view loops through the browser agent’s actions.

## Artifacts > Knowledge

### Knowledge
Knowledge Items are Antigravity's persistent memory system that automatically captures and organizes important insights, patterns, and solutions from your coding sessions. They help you build upon previous work across conversations.

### What is a Knowledge Item?
A Knowledge Item is a collection of related information on a specific topic. Each Knowledge Item contains a title and summary describing what it covers, and a collection of artifacts providing information on the topic. Possible examples of artifacts include automatically generated documentation, code examples, or persistent memories of user instructions.

### How are Knowledge Items Generated?
As you interact with the agent, Antigravity automatically analyzes and extracts information from your conversation and uses that information to create new KIs or update existing KIs.

### Viewing Knowledge Items
You can view your Knowledge Items in the Antigravity Agent Manager.

### Knowledge View
How are Knowledge Items used by the Agent?
The summaries of all your Knowledge Items are available to the agent, which uses them to inform its responses. When the agent identifies a Knowledge Item that is relevant to the conversation, it will automatically study the artifacts in that Knowledge Item and use the applicable information.

## Agent Manager > Workspaces > Playground

### Playground
Playgrounds are independent workspaces that allow you to start a conversation and explore ideas instantly, without the overhead of setting up a new workspace.

### Creating a Playground
From the Start Conversation page, you can quickly send a message to a new playground by clicking the Use Playground button below the input box.

### Playground Button
From here, you can send a message as you would normally.

### Playground Send Message
Persisting Your Work
If you want to keep the work you've done in a playground, you can move its contents into a dedicated workspace in a folder of your choosing. This action preserves your conversation history and any files created during your session, allowing you to continue exploring with multiple conversations.

### Playground Persist
Clicking on the move button in the top bar will pop up the following modal:

### Playground Move Modal
Workspaces

## Agent Manager > Workspaces > Inbox

### Inbox
The inbox is your one stop shop to track all of your conversations in one place. From the inbox you can see if any of your conversations are awaiting your approval to run terminal commands, use the browser, or build out an implementation plan.

### Inbox Overview
You can use the search bar and the pending switch to search for conversations by folder or by title to make sure your inbox is always focused on what is most relevant to you.

Selecting a conversation from the inbox will jump directly to the conversation, where you can continue where you left off.

### Continue Conversation

## Agent Manager > Conversation View > Browser Subagent View

### Browser Subagent View
Overview
The Manager has a dedicated side panel that allows you to expand and inspect the Agent’s work for a task.

### Browser Subagent View
In the regular manager conversation view (left half of the image), the browser subagent’s work is hidden. Clicking the expand button (shown in red box) will bring up the subagent view (right half of the image). Updates to the Agent’s work will be streamed into this view, so you can follow along and interact with steps as required (e.g. confirm/deny actions).

### What’s in the side panel
All subagent actions (clicking, scrolling, navigating, etc.)
Visual feedback showing exactly where clicks happened
Screenshots captured at each step
Visual Inspection Feature
Tool calls that produce actions in the browser, like clicks, include a button (shown in blue box) which opens a screenshot of the browser at that exact moment and a red dot showing what interaction the agent has done in the browser.

Conversation View

## Agent Manager > Conversation View > Panes

### Panes
You can open files, artifacts, knowledge items, and other content directly within the manager in panes that persist per-conversation. In order to open up a pane, simply open up the quick picker (by hitting CMD+P on Mac or CTRL+P on Windows/Linux) and select a resource. You can also hit the "+" from within a conversation's header.

### Manager New Tab
Manager File Picker
These panes are resizable, splittable, and drag-and-droppable. You should configure them around as makes sense for your workflow.

### Manager Split Pane
If you use CMD+Click or CMD+Enter (Mac) or CTRL+Click / CTRL+Enter (non-Mac), the contents will open in a new pane, rather than replacing the currently open pane.

Browser Subagent View

## Agent Manager > Conversation View > Review Changes + Source Control

### Review Changes + Source Control
Just as in the editor, you can easily review the work you and your agent have collaborated on from within the manager.

Once you enter a conversation, you can toggle the Review Changes pane through the button at the top right to open up a pane where you can scroll through and comment on any file diffs made as a part of the conversation.

### Review Changes Manager
You can similarly toggle to the Source Control tab within the Review Changes pane to see changed files, stage or unstage them, and commit them upstream.

### Manager Source Control

## Agent Manager > Conversation View > Changes Sidebar

### Changes Sidebar
Similar to the toolbar at the bottom of the editor's Agent Panel, the Changes Sidebar in the manager offers a quick way to see what artifacts the agent has created and what files it has modified within a conversation.

Clicking on any of the listed resources will open its contents within a pane. The icons on each resource indicate whether there are new changes to a resource since your last review.

### Aux Sidebar
Review Changes + Source Control

## Agent Manager > Conversation View > Terminal

### Terminal
The agent manager window has terminal support as well! To toggle this, use Cmd/Ctrl + J to open the bottom pane of the agent manager, which is where terminals live. They are attached to the workspace that your current conversation is in.

Note: Agent manager window's terminal integration works for local workspaces only, and Agent-used terminals run inside the editor window.

## Browser > Chrome Extension

### Chrome Extension
Antigravity Browser Extension is required for the Antigravity Agent to access the web.

It empowers the agent to see and interact with websites to complete your development goals, whether you are building a site from scratch or automating a workflow.

It enhances the user experience by allowing the user to cancel the current conversation from the browser, switch the focus back to Antigravity from the web agent is working on, and more seamlessly work parallely with the browser agent.

The first time you use the Antigravity browser agent, you should be directed to the Chrome Web Store to install the extension.

### Troubleshooting
If for any reason you need to manually install it:

Click the Chrome icon in Antigravity (opens Chrome with Antigravity user profile)
In the editor, you can find the Chrome icon on the top right
In the Agent Manager, you can find the Chrome icon on the bottom left
Navigate to the URL and click “Add to Chrome”
Browser

## Browser > Allowlist / Denylist

### Allowlist / Denylist
The browser uses a two-layer security system to control which URLs can be accessed:

Denylist - Deny dangerous/malicious URLs
Allowlist - Explicitly allow trusted URLs
How It Works
Denylist
The denylist is maintained and enforced using the Google Superroots’s BadUrlsChecker service (See documentation). When the browser attempts to navigate to a URL, the hostname is checked against the server-side denylist via RPC.

NOTE: If the server is unavailable, access is denied by default.

Allowlist
The allowlist is a local text file that you can edit to explicitly trust specific URLs.

### Allowlist
Optionally, you can prepopulate the allowlist with a default set of URLs during onboarding.

### Default Allowlist
When the browser attempts to navigate to a non-allowlisted URL, it will prompt you with an “always allow” button, which if clicked will add the URL to the allowlist and enable the browser to open and interact with the web page. An example situation is shown below:

### Always Allow
You can also add/remove URLS from the allowlist manually. However, the denylist always takes precedence: you cannot allowlist a URL that appears on the denylist.

Chrome Extension

## Browser > Separate Chrome Profile

### Separate Chrome Profile
To isolate the browser from your general browsing, it operates on a separate Chrome profile.

Since Chrome profiles are isolated, this will not share any of the cookies or sign-in information from your normal browsing profile. However, all sign-ins will be persisted such that anytime you open the browser in the future, all your accounts will still be there. This profile should also contain your installation of the Chrome Extension, so that your normal browsing profile is entirely unaffected.

If you had your normal Chrome open while launching this profile, it will show up as a separate dock icon and be considered a separate application. If Chrome was not open beforehand, this application will look the same as your default profile. To return to the default profile, you must quit the application and relaunch Chrome.

If you would like to change the location where your browser profile will be created, you can modify the following setting in the browser section.

## Plans

### Plans
At this moment, Google Antigravity is only available as a no-cost public preview. This plan is for use by individual accounts, with terms derived from Google's terms of service, not Google Cloud's enterprise terms of service.

Within the public preview, users receive:

A generous rate limit of Gemini 3 Pro
A more conservative combined rate limit of other offered Vertex Model Garden models
These rate limits are primarily determined to the degree we have capacity, and exist to prevent abuse. Quota is refreshed every five hours. Under the hood, the rate limits are correlated with the amount of work done by the agent, which can differ from prompt to prompt. Thus, you may get many more prompts if your tasks are more straightforward and the agent can complete the work quickly, and the opposite is also true. Our modeling suggests that a very small fraction of power users will ever hit the per-five-hour rate limit, so our hope is that this is something that you won't have to worry about, and you feel unrestrained in your usage of Antigravity.

There is currently no support for:

Bring-your-own-key or bring-your-own-endpoint for additional rate limits
Organizational tiers (self-serve or via contract)
Separate Chrome Profile

## Settings
You can configure your Antigravity settings across Agent, Browser, Editor, and more via:

Keyboard shortcut in any surface: Cmd + ,
From the Settings tab or gear icon in the Agent Manager
From "Settings > Open Antigravity User Settings" in the Editor
Data Collection Settings
The "Enable Telemetry" setting can be found in the Settings panel under the "Account" section. When toggled on, Antigravity collects interactions for use in evaluating, developing, and improving Antigravity and models that support Antigravity.
